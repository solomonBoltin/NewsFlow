Strategy for Extracting URLs from HTML:
Here's a detailed explanation of the process I used to generate the list of URLs from the provided HTML snippets:
1. Identifying the Base URL:
I started by looking for the rel="canonical" tag within the <head> section of the HTML. This tag usually points to the preferred URL that search engines should index for the webpage.
In both examples (Reuters and CNN), the href attribute of the canonical tag provided the base URL for the respective websites.
2. Analyzing Navigation Structure:
I focused on the website's main navigation menu, typically found within the <header> or <nav> tags. This is where websites usually present their key sections and content categories.
For each navigation item:
I extracted the text content, which represented the section or category name.
I extracted the URL from the href attribute of the anchor tag (<a>).
I combined the base URL with the extracted path to form the complete, standardized URL.
3. Recognizing Sub-navigation and Hierarchical Structure:
I observed whether the navigation menu had any nested elements, indicating sub-categories within a section.
For sub-navigation items, I followed the same process as the main navigation items, but I also noted the parent section to maintain the hierarchical structure.
4. Additional Considerations:
Specific Components and Tags: I paid attention to specific HTML components and tags that might contain relevant URLs. For instance, in the CNN example, the "Featured" and "Photos You Should See" sections had their own components with specific URLs.
Embedded Categories: I noted instances where categories were embedded within broader sections, like "Success" within "Business" and "Wellness" within "Health" on CNN.
Live Updates and Video Sections: I looked for any sections dedicated to live updates or video content, as they often have unique URLs and formats.
Assumptions and Limitations: I assumed the provided HTML represented the typical navigation structure of the websites. I acknowledged that the analysis might not be exhaustive and that there could be additional URLs not captured in the provided snippets.
Tools and Techniques:
Primarily, I relied on my understanding of HTML structure and common web development practices for navigation menus.
I mentally parsed the HTML structure and extracted the relevant information.
If the HTML were more complex, I could have used tools like web scraping libraries or browser developer tools to assist in the extraction process.
Overall, the approach involved a combination of HTML parsing, understanding website structure, and making informed assumptions to present a comprehensive list of standardized URLs for various sections and content categories on the given news websites.
